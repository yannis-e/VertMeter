## How does VertMeter work?

This tool helps you calculate your jump height from a video.

1. Upload a video showing your jump.
2. Use the frame buttons to find the exact takeoff point and mark it with "Mark Start".
3. Then find the landing point and mark it with "Mark End".
4. Press "Calculate Jump Height" to get the result.

The program calculates the flight time between start and landing and determines your jump height from that.
